# Curse Game


## Intro

### Story
The group just murdered the dragon and got cursed, set back to the begining of
the adventure with an additional bloodthirst working around them. The only
hope is to perform one of the curse cleansing rituals or cleanse the curse
by other means before they are all consumed.

### Gameplay
You are all cursed and need to find the cure to eradicate the curse before it consumes you all! The most straight forward way is to bring the materials to
respawn the dragon to the shrine in the end to cure everyone, but there are also additional shrines at various structures around the map that provide smaller
rituals which cure just a few people each. Right-click a shrine to either get the description of the ritual or submit items to it if holding any. The game ends
when all remaining living players are cured of the curse. The curse will periodically emerge inside one of the players, at which point it will take all their
lives and kill them if they aren't able to obtain at least one either by trading, or through a special option only available to the activated: murder. If they
are not able to, the curse will consume them and all their lives for good! To trade lives to another player, you can either use the /trade-lives command, or the
life info GUI, accessible with l by default.
